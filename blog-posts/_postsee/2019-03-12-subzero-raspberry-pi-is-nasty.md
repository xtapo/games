A device that allows users to quickly and securely share files locally. 

Let's imagine that you were having a get together with friends to talk about your last big trip, & you wanted to share tons of images/videos with each other but you didn't want to publish it to a coporate cloud like [**Google**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google). You could just utilize this solution to privately share those files amongst each other.
 
Here, you can find the [**instructions to create SUBZero**](https://www.hackster.io/135000/subzero-a-simple-network-attached-storage-device-3f47be).
