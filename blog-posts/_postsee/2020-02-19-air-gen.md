Solar power needs concentrated sunlight, wind power requires strong winds, and hydroelectric power requires strong currents, but now there's a new green technology that only needs the air around it. 

Researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst have recently [**developed a device**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2010-9) to create electricity, only using moisture in the air by leveraging naturally occurring proteins.
