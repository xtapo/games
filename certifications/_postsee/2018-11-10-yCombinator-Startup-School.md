[Startup School](https://blog.ycombinator.com/announcing-startup-school-2018/) is a free, 10-week, online course. Itâ€™s designed for any startup founder who would like to get help through the earliest, most difficult challenges of starting a company.

[Niko Lazaris](https://twitter.com/nikolazaris) and I applied to YCombinator's Startup School August 2018 and we got accepted. We worked heavily on [Flashcards for Developers](https://www.flashcardsfordevelopers.com/) during that time and learned several invaluable lessons through the process.

And after 10 stressful weeks we obtained our [certificate](https://www.startupschool.org/companies/-uqK5XHyMZZWNA).
